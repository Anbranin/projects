In this assignment you will write two classes, Project3 and
UseArray. The UseArray class includes a private integer array, myArray.
This class contains the following five methods:


 1. constructor, which creates the array. The constructor takes a
 single integer parameter: an integer representing the length of
 the array.
 =============

 2.A readValues method that prompts a user for integer input values,
 reads the values, and stores them in the array. The method only
 stores inputs that are odd multiples of 3 in the array. Prompting
 and reading continues until the array either is full or the value
 999 is entered. If 999 is entered before any values were stored,
 an appropriate error message should be printed and the prompting
 and reading process should be restarted. You should not store the
 value 999 in the array.


 3. A findAverage method that finds and returns the average (mean)
 the values stored in the array. The mean is the sum of the stored
 values divided by the number of stored values. The returned
 values is of type double.


4. A findDifference method that calculates and returns the
 difference between the largest value and the smallest value
 stored in the array.

 5. A printValues method that prints the values stored in the array
 in reverse order from the order in which they are stored (e.g.
 the last value stored should be printed first, the second-to-last
 value should be printed second, and so forth). Only non-zero
 values in the array should be printed.
