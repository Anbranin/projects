Oh well he's ten and he's this tall, so if he's 20 years old,
he'll be twice as tall. So they didn't really think about the
answer, they are like Oh three meters. But we're just doing that
today in class; we had all these collections of data.

One of the heights of the students went from 27 to 82 inches
and I was like well.. how many feet would that be.. and this kid
was trying to tell me that there was someone in the world that was
9 feet tall.
